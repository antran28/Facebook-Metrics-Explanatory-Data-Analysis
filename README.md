## âœ¨ Introduction

The following project focus on the issue of email spam detection and designing a machine learning program that can identify, through classification, to prevent spam entering the email box. The data was collected from Kaggle

View source of data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification)

The project is structured as follows:

- Data Importing
- Feature Engineering
- Data Cleaning and Processing
- Data Exploratory and Visualization
- Text Classification Model

Language used: Python

## âœ¨ Project Objects:
- Create a Python based classifier utilizing Navie Bayes machine learning model
- Observe the accuracy of these models based on certain measure indicators
- Implement the final product in email clients which will preemtively scan incoming emails and automatically classify emails as 'ham' or 'spam' prior to them entering the inbox
